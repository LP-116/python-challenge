# Python Challenge
## Python Homework - Py Me Up, Charlie!

### Task
There are two challenges in this homework task - PyBank and PyPoll.

In the PyBank challenge we are required to analyse the financial records of a company using a Python script. 
We are provided with a budget_data.csv file which contains two columns: _Date_ and _Profit/Losses_

A Python script needs to be created that analyses the budget file and provides the below results:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
* Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes.
* The greatest increase in profits over the entire period - include the month and amount.
* The greatest decrease in losses over the entire period - include the month and amount.

The results need to be printed to the terminal and a text file with the results needs to be exported.
